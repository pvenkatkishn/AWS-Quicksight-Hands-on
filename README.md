QuickSight Hands-on Summary: 

1. I worked primarily with the Saas-Sales(.csv) file to create multiple dashboards on Quicksight, a few of which have been attached here.
I experimented using different themes, field formats, visual formatting, performed calculations and also added an interactivity feature to my dashboard.

2. I imported datasets from S3 buckets, utilizing Direct Query and SPICE, and ensured data security with row and column-level security features.

3. I also took advantage of Amazon Q to build and edit visuals, perform calculations, and create insightful data stories. I generated paginated reports to improve reader experience.

4. Using Cloud9, I set up admin and user privileges via CLI, and employed anonymous embedding to create dynamic and static websites.

5. I used AWS Lambda to create roles for dummy users, developed REST APIs with API Gateway, and integrated them with Lambda functions.

6. To manage user-based embedding, I used Amazon Cognito and configured IAM for identity providers and role creation.
